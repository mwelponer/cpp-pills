# Pointers

std::cout << "myVariable memory address is " << &myVariable // get the memory address 
// retrieve the memory address corresponding to the start of myVariable

int* myPointer = &myVariable; // declare & set a pointer 
// now myPointer points to myVariable holds the memory address of myVariable

anotherVariable = *myPointer // dereference the pointer (reading)
// assign/writes 3 (the value pointed by myPointer) to anotherVariable

*myPointer = 3; // dereference the pointer (writing)
// assign/writes 3 to the variable pointed by myPointer

(*myPointer)++; // dereference and then increment
// increment the value held by the variable pointed by myPointer


# References

int& myReference = myVariable; // declare & set a reference
// myReference now is an alias of myVariable

myReference = 3
// assign/writes 3 to the variable referenced by myPointer
